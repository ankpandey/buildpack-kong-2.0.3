Upgrading the Kong buildpack for Heroku
=======================================
KONG 2.0.3

üëì See [Kong's official upgrade path](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/UPGRADE.md).


To support rapid deployments using a pre-compiled Kong binary.

Kong's filesystem prefix is changing in this buildpack:

> `/app/.heroku` ‚Üí `/app/kong-runtime`

In your app's `config/kong.conf.etlua` file, change the **prefix** value to `/app/kong-runtime/`, & commit the change.

Search your app for `.heroku` to find any other instances of `/app/.heroku` that may need to be updated to `/app/kong-runtime`.

‚≠êÔ∏è *A backward-compatibility patch is applied automatically, linking `/app/.heroku` to `/app/kong-runtime`. We still advise using the new prefix to avoid any strange behavior from invoking executables through a symbolic link.*


We advise recreating your Kong app & its configuration using this newest version.
